# OBS - Online Book Store #

This project is mainly been focused around building an e-commerce website which provides the 
various books for sale to their customers using the MERN stack.  
The application loads books from MongoDB database and displays them. 
Users can click on any book to get more information including pricing, reviews and rating etc. 
Users can select books and add them to their shopping cart and can place order as well by providing some additional info
like shipping , payment etc.
